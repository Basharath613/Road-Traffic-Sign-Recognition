# Road-Traffic-Sign-Recognition

## Overview :
This project is developed by me as part of an internship at a company.

Traffic sign recognition is the process of automatically identifying which class the respective sign belongs to. The earlier Computer Vision techniques required lots of hard work in data processing and it took a lot of time to manually extract the features of the image. Instead, today deep learning techniques have become more popular for performing computer vision or image processing tasks. The goal of this project is to build a traffic sign recognition system for autonomous vehicles.


## Dataset :
German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (GTSRB) is an image classification dataset.
The images used in this dataset are those of traffic signs. The images are classified into 43 different classes. The training set contains 39209 labeled images and the test set contains 12630 images.


## Environments used :
-> Anaconda Navigator (jupyter notebook and spyder)

-> PyCharm


## Libraries used :
-> pandas

-> numpy

-> matplotlib

-> sklearn

-> pillow

-> os

-> keras (with tensorflow backend)

-> tkinter (for deployment of the model)
